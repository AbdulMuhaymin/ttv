# Homogeneous Transit Timing Analyses of 10 Exoplanet Systems 

### This repository is hosted using Github Pages at: https://abdulmuhaymin.github.io/ttv/

## What is this?
This repository contains an interface to access all the data used in the study "Homogeneous Transit Timing Analyses of Ten Exoplanet Systems", Baștürk et al. (2022a). It doesn't contain any code, source exofast models or data files. It only contains necessary data files with the html files and images. All the code and necessary data files are stored in a dropbox folder.

## How is this made? 
All the codes are written in python3. The primary library that we used to create the visualization is *Bokeh*. We used *pandas* to clean and prepare the data. To generate the html files, we used *airium* (based on *yattag*) library. Aside from these, we frequently used *glob*, *numpy*, *os*, *shutil* etc. The CSS style is inspired from *W3Schools*.
